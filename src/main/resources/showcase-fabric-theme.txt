The theme of the mod is improved agriculture blended with some adventure and (implied, but possibly explicitly?) progression.
A core theme will be TIME, specifically, day/night cycles. New crops will be added that will be "dayCrops",
	that grow from x amount of day/night cycles passed--this replaces the vanilla "random tick" model,
	and provides the player with incentive to gain items/methods of manipulating time (1).
	
	The usage of these crops is still undetermined completely. What I know for sure, is I want
	them to be used for some sort of progression to make MORE crops easier to get. This could be through
	crafting materials (easiest), trading with custom villagers (medium), or some other system (hardest?).
	
	I also want to add a custom dimension that has specific crops that aren't available in the overworld
	(if I can't get this working relatively quickly, default to Nether/End variants), and perhaps a custom
	entity or two that help in farming in some way. Also, fertilizers.
	
*1 The most basic idea is to use the clock item (or modded clock items) in a particular way. 
	which allows them to either skip a day/night, or with progression, skip multiple, or manipulate time
	in specific ways (like adding a particular amount of ticks, instead of a multiple of full day/night).
